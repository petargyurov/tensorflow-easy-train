## Tensorflow Easy Train

A script to easily fine-tune a pre-trained TF model for custom object detection.
Based on [this TF tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/colab_tutorials/eager_few_shot_od_training_tf2_colab.ipynb).

### TODO

- [x] refactor tutorial code
- [ ] utility to download models
- [ ] utility to clone models repo and install Protobuf
- [ ] generalise to multiple classes
- [ ] generalise to other models configurations
- [ ] read and write to `pipeline.config` instead of coding config
